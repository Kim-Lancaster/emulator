# Implementation Plan: A Cross-Platform Mobile Application

**Branch**: `001-mobile-terminal-access` | **Date**: 2025-10-09 | **Spec**: ../spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-mobile-terminal-access/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Primary requirement: Enable remote access to persistent terminal sessions on a host machine for tools like opencode.ai. Technical approach: React Native app with webview embedding ttyd server, tmux for persistence, and networking tools for discovery and security.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (React Native), Shell (server scripts)
**Primary Dependencies**: React Native, react-native-webview, ttyd, tmux, qrencode, mkcert
**Storage**: AsyncStorage (app data), tmux (session persistence)
**Testing**: Jest (unit), Detox (e2e)
**Target Platform**: iOS, Android (mobile), Linux/macOS (server)
**Project Type**: Mobile + CLI server
**Performance Goals**: Connection <5s, command execution <1s, session persistence across closures
**Constraints**: Local network or VPN access, offline-capable sessions, cross-platform compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, 1-5 screens, basic terminal functionality

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Tool-First Design: Using tools-decided.md for all selections.
- Logging-Driven Development: Following development-log.md and logging-guide.md.
- Test-First Implementation: TDD for critical components.
- Integration and Compatibility Testing: Testing React Native + ttyd + tmux.
- Simplicity and Observability: Minimal features, structured logging.
- Additional Constraints: Adhering to local network, TLS, no unapproved libs.
- Development Workflow: Aggressive logging, commit with hashes, review against constitution.

```

**Structure Decision**: Mobile + server structure for cross-platform app with CLI backend. Mobile uses React Native standard layout; server uses simple scripts for deployment ease.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
