# Feature Specification: A Cross-Platform Mobile Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-mobile-terminal-access`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "A cross-platform mobile application that enables remote access to persistent terminal sessions on a host machine, facilitating tools like opencode.ai. Users can run commands, view output, and maintain sessions over local networks or VPN, with built-in virtual keyboard controls for essential keys like Esc, Ctrl+C, Tab, arrows and scrolling."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09
- Q: Host Offline Behavior → A: Save session state locally and attempt automatic reconnection with backoff
- Q: Large Output Handling → A: Warn user and allow manual clearing
- Q: Multiple Users Handling → A: Block additional connections with an error message

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Connect to Host Terminal (Priority: P1)

Users need to establish a connection to their host machine's terminal from the mobile app to access persistent sessions.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality required for any terminal interaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying connection establishment and basic command execution without full session persistence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the app is installed and host server is running, **When** user scans QR code or enters IP, **Then** connection is established within 5 seconds.
2. **Given** a connection is active, **When** user enters a command, **Then** output is displayed in real-time.

---

### User Story 2 - Run Commands and View Output (Priority: P1)

Users must be able to execute commands and see results in the terminal interface.

**Why this priority**: Essential for using tools like opencode.ai.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running simple commands and verifying output display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a terminal session is active, **When** user types a command and presses enter, **Then** the command executes and output appears.
2. **Given** a long-running command, **When** it produces output, **Then** it updates in real-time without blocking the interface.

---

### User Story 3 - Maintain Persistent Sessions (Priority: P1)

Sessions should persist across app closures and reconnections for uninterrupted work.

**Why this priority**: Critical for long-term tasks like development with opencode.ai.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by closing the app, reopening, and verifying session state is restored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active session with running processes, **When** user closes the app and reopens, **Then** session resumes with processes intact.
2. **Given** a session is idle, **When** user reconnects after network interruption, **Then** session history is preserved.

---

### User Story 4 - Use Virtual Keyboard Controls (Priority: P2)

Users need virtual controls for terminal-specific keys not available on mobile keyboards.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability for terminal operations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using virtual keys and verifying they send correct inputs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the terminal is focused, **When** user taps virtual Esc key, **Then** escape sequence is sent.
2. **Given** the terminal is focused, **When** user taps virtual Ctrl+C, **Then** interrupt signal is sent.

---

### User Story 5 - Scroll Through Terminal History (Priority: P2)

Users should access previous output that scrolls off-screen.

**Why this priority**: Important for reviewing command history and output.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating long output and verifying scroll functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** terminal output exceeds screen height, **When** user scrolls, **Then** previous content becomes visible.
2. **Given** scroll position, **When** new output appears, **Then** view can jump to bottom.

### Edge Cases

- If host machine goes offline during session: Save session state locally and attempt automatic reconnection with backoff.
- For very large output that could impact performance: Warn user and allow manual clearing.
- If multiple users try to connect to the same host session: Block additional connections with an error message.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to connect to a host machine's terminal via local network or VPN.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable execution of commands and real-time display of output.
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain terminal sessions persistently across app closures and reconnections.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide virtual keyboard controls for Esc, Ctrl+C, Tab, arrow keys.
- **FR-005**: System MUST support scrolling through terminal history.
- **FR-006**: System MUST support cross-platform deployment on iOS and Android.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Terminal Session**: Represents an active connection with command history, running processes, and output.
- **Host Machine**: The remote server providing terminal access.
- **User**: Mobile app user with connection credentials.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can establish a connection in under 5 seconds on local network.
