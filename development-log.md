- **Pending Items:** Implement React Native app structure, set up server CLI with ttyd and tmux.
- **Conventions:** Use aggressive logging in development-log.md; commit changes with descriptive messages; follow tools-decided.md for tech choices.
- **Next Steps:** Start React Native project setup with Expo CLI; create basic app structure and webview integration.
