I wan you to generate a high level plan (no code!) for a flutter app that will use a ttyd as the backend to allow me to open a terminal session so I can access opencode running on my laptop from my phone. it should have two things. the app its self as well as a "server" app that can be installed on linux or mac. the server can be command line. nothing fancy. just need something that will automate the setup of the ttyd session and any associated tasks needed for this to work. the phone side should embed the browser window inside a stand alone app and give the user some basic additional buttons like arrow keys, a dedicated CTRL key, ESC key, TAB key. there needs to be some way to scroll through the terminal session to see things that are no longer on screen. it should have some way to establish a connection to the server app. it should also allow for multiple tabed sessions to run at the same time. it will be assumed the phone app and server app running on the host pc will be on the same network. either directly or via vpn like wireguard. it should be simple and modern looking. it should be very fast to establish a connection and the connection should persist in the background and not shutshow if the user closes their phone.
