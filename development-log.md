## Session Summaries

### Session 1: Tool Selection and Repo Setup
- **Current State:** Tools decided and documented in tools-decided.md; GitHub repo set up with initial commit.
- **Completed Tasks:** Evaluated and selected tools for frontend (React Native, etc.), server (ttyd, tmux), networking (mDNS, WireGuard), and other (ESLint); created frontend-directions.md for reference; set up Git and GitHub.
- **Pending Items:** Implement React Native app structure, set up server CLI with ttyd and tmux.
- **Conventions:** Use aggressive logging in development-log.md; commit changes with descriptive messages; follow tools-decided.md for tech choices.
- **Next Steps:** Start React Native project setup with Expo CLI; create basic app structure and webview integration.</content>
