# Session Summary: 2025-10-16

## Where We Left Off
- **Project Status**: Mobile terminal app is functional on both emulator and physical device. User can connect to ttyd server on port 3000, execute commands, and run opencode.ai with partial functionality.
- **Current Issue**: Typing in the terminal WebView is inconsistent – sometimes normal, sometimes multiple letters appear/delay/disappear. Suspected causes: WebView input handling, VirtualKeyboard interference, network latency, or ttyd configuration.
- **Last Action**: Analyzed potential causes and planned diagnostics (inspect WebView/VirtualKeyboard, test isolation, add logging).

## My Last Response (Analysis of Typing Issues)
The described behavior (intermittent normal typing, sudden multiple letters, delayed appearances, or disappearances) suggests input synchronization problems between the mobile app's WebView, the VirtualKeyboard component, and the ttyd server. This is common in web-based terminal emulators due to event handling, latency, or buffering issues.

### Potential Causes
1. **WebView Input Handling**:
   - WebView may not reliably capture or forward keyboard events to ttyd's WebSocket.
   - Focus issues: WebView losing/gaining focus mid-typing could cause dropped or queued inputs.
   - Android WebView quirks: Known for input lag or event duplication in complex UIs.

2. **VirtualKeyboard Interference**:
   - The VirtualKeyboard injects JavaScript for special keys (e.g., `injectJavaScript` for Esc, arrows).
   - Regular typing might conflict if the component intercepts or delays standard key events.
   - Possible race conditions: VirtualKeyboard events overlapping with native WebView inputs.

3. **Network/WebSocket Latency**:
   - LAN connection, but minor delays could cause out-of-order key presses.
   - ttyd/WebSocket buffering: Inputs sent in batches, leading to bursts or drops.

4. **React Native Platform Issues**:
   - WebView on Android may have threading issues with UI updates.
   - No `onKeyPress` or similar in WebView; relies on HTML input elements.

5. **ttyd Configuration**:
   - Running `ttyd -p 3000 bash` – no special options for input handling.
   - Could benefit from `--readonly` or custom client-side JS, but not configured.

6. **App State/Redux**:
   - Session management might interfere if updates trigger re-renders during typing.

### Diagnostic Plan (Read-Only Analysis)
1. **Inspect WebView Setup**:
   - Review `TerminalScreen.tsx`: Check WebView props (e.g., `keyboardDisplayRequiresUserAction`, `onMessage` for events).
   - Look for `onError`, `onHttpError` – any logged issues?

2. **Analyze VirtualKeyboard**:
   - Read `VirtualKeyboard.tsx`: Examine `injectJavaScript` usage and key event handling.
   - Check for conflicts with regular input (e.g., does it override `onKeyDown`?).

3. **Test Isolation**:
   - Plan: Temporarily disable VirtualKeyboard in `TerminalScreen.tsx` to test if issues persist with native keyboard.
   - Access ttyd directly in browser on device: `http://10.222.3.71:3000` – compare typing behavior.

4. **Add Logging**:
   - Plan: Inject console.log in WebView for key events (e.g., via `injectedJavaScript`).
   - Monitor ADB logs: `adb logcat` for WebView errors.

5. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Review `package.json`: Ensure `react-native-webview` is latest (current issues fixed in newer versions?).

### Proposed Fixes (Plan Only)
- **Update WebView Props**: Add `keyboardDisplayRequiresUserAction={false}`, `autoManageStatusBarEnabled={false}`.
- **Refine VirtualKeyboard**: Ensure it only handles special keys; let WebView manage text input.
- **Add Input Buffering**: Implement client-side debouncing for key events.
- **ttyd Options**: Add `-r` for readonly mode or custom JS to stabilize input.
- **Fallback**: Use `react-native-tty` or similar if WebView proves unreliable.

### Next Steps
- Execute diagnostics by reading relevant files.
- If VirtualKeyboard suspected, plan a minimal test build without it.
- Report findings for implementation.

## Services to Restart After Shutdown
- **ttyd Server**: Currently running on port 3000 (PID from earlier logs). After reboot, re-run `./server/scripts/start.sh` to restart ttyd with tmux.
- **Firewall**: UFW rules persist, but verify `sudo ufw status` post-reboot.
- **No Other Services**: Expo/Metro not running persistently.

## Resume Point
Start by inspecting `TerminalScreen.tsx` and `VirtualKeyboard.tsx` for input handling issues. Proceed with diagnostics to isolate the typing problem.
